# Wireframe Validation Report

## Validation Status
**Status**: Incorrect

## Issues Identified:
1. **Missing Elements**:
   - Email Input Field label is incorrectly set to "Input Field 1".
   - Password Input Field label is incorrectly set to "Input Field 2".
   - Login Button label is incorrectly set to "Submit".
   - Error Message Box is always visible; it should be initially hidden.

2. **Accessibility Issues**:
   - The email and password fields do not have proper accessibility labels associated with them for screen readers.
   - The error message role should be triggered based on error states clearly.

3. **Responsive Design Issues**:
   - No media queries provided; the layout does not adjust on smaller screens.
   - No minimum size for interactive elements defined.

4. **General Comments**:
   - The image section is a placeholder but doesn’t describe relevant content related to the login theme.
   - The form section lacks a title or heading to indicate the purpose of the form.

## Suggested Improvements:
- Correct the labels for the input fields and button to match UI specifications.
- Implement CSS for responsiveness with media queries to transition to single-column layouts on smaller screens.
- Add initial visibility control for the error message box.
- Ensure proper ARIA attributes are included for accessibility compliance.
- Introduce clear headers for both the form section and the error messages.
