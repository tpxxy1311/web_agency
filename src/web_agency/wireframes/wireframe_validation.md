## Wireframe Validation Report

This report summarizes the validation of the provided wireframe against the defined UI components and layout requirements.

**Overall Status:** The wireframe largely meets the requirements but requires minor improvements for optimal accessibility and responsiveness.

**Missing Elements/Layout Inconsistencies:**

- Placeholder text is missing in input fields.
- ARIA attributes for accessibility are missing.
- While responsiveness is suggested by the structure, explicit media queries should be added for improved adaptability across devices.
- Input fields and buttons lack labels which is critical for accessibility.

**Improvement Suggestions:**

- **Add Placeholder Text:** Include placeholder text within the email and password input fields to guide users.
- **Implement ARIA Attributes:**  Use ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`) to provide more context to screen readers.
- **Add Media Queries:** Implement media queries to ensure responsive behavior across different screen sizes.
- **Include Input Labels:** Add labels (e.g., `<label>Email:</label>`) for all input fields for better accessibility.

**Detailed Findings:**
- All required elements are present, including input fields, buttons, an image, and error message areas.
- The layout generally aligns with the requirements, with the image on the left and the form on the right.
- No overlapping elements were found.
- Semantic HTML is used, but ARIA attributes are needed for improved accessibility.

**Conclusion:** The wireframe provides a good foundation, but the recommended improvements are crucial for making the login screen fully accessible and user-friendly.
